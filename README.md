# Video-player

Simple and minimum, yet another [mpv](https://mpv.io/) frontend based on [LibMPVDelphi](https://github.com/nbuyer/libmpvdelphi).

Currently, **under development**.

Even though Video-player utilize the libmpv library to play videos, it does not use any other functionalities of mpv such as scripts or on-screen controls. It just simply plays videos quickly and easily without being overwhelemed by vast number of options. If you want full control and customization, this player isn't for you.
